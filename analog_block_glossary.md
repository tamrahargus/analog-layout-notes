# 📚 Analog Block Glossary

A simplified guide to common analog building blocks—what they do and why they matter. Written in plain language, for fast recall or explaining concepts to newer engineers.

### 🔄 Current Mirror
Copies current from one branch of a circuit to another.  
> Think of it as cloning a known current to use somewhere else, often for biasing.

### ⚖️ Differential Pair
Compares two voltages and converts the difference into current.  
> It's the heart of amplifiers and decision-making in analog circuits.

### 🚰 Bias Generator
Creates stable currents or voltages for other blocks to use.  
> Kind of like a regulated water source that feeds other systems reliably.

### 📈 Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp)
Amplifies the difference between two input signals.  
> The Swiss Army knife of analog—it can amplify, filter, buffer, or compare signals.

### 🎚️ Voltage Reference
Provides a constant voltage regardless of supply or temperature changes.  
> Essential for analog accuracy—like a ruler that always measures the same.

### 🧲 Bandgap Reference
A special type of voltage reference that stays stable over temperature.  
> Used inside chips where precision is needed, like ADCs and PLLs.

### ⏱️ Comparator
Tells you which of two voltages is higher—binary output.  
> Like a referee blowing the whistle: "This one wins."

### 🔄 Charge Pump
Converts voltage levels using capacitors and switches.  
> Lets you boost or invert voltages—often used in PLLs or EEPROM.

### 🧱 Low Dropout Regulator (LDO)
Maintains a steady output voltage even when the input is just barely higher.  
> Like a power filter—it smooths out noise and keeps things steady.

### ⌚ Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)
Generates a precise clock by locking onto a reference.  
> Converts one frequency into another—used for timing, communication, etc.

### 🎚️ ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
Takes a real-world signal (voltage) and turns it into numbers.  
> Bridges the analog and digital worlds.

### 📉 DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter)
Does the opposite of an ADC—turns numbers into a voltage.  
> Lets digital systems control analog output.
