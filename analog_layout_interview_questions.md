# ðŸŽ¤ Common Interview Questions for Analog Layout

A running list of technical and situational questions commonly asked in analog/mixed-signal layout interviews.

---

## ðŸ§  Technical Questions

### Device-Level Layout
- How do you lay out a differential pair?
- What's the purpose of dummy devices?
- When would you use a common centroid layout?
- How do you minimize mismatch in analog layout?
- What is latch-up and how do you prevent it?

### ESD & Guard Rings
- What are typical ESD strategies at the pad level?
- How do guard rings help with latch-up and noise isolation?
- Where do you place substrate and well ties?

### Parasitics & Routing
- How do you minimize parasitics in sensitive analog paths?
- What routing techniques are best for matching critical signals?
- How do you shield high-impedance or noise-sensitive nets?

### Top-Level Analog Layout
- How do you floorplan an analog block with respect to digital blocks?
- What considerations go into placing a PLL or ADC near noisy signals?
- What factors influence your power/ground routing strategy?

## ðŸ¤” Behavioral / Situational
- Describe a time you found a layout error before tapeout.
- How do you communicate with circuit designers when a layout conflict arises?
- Whatâ€™s your workflow for LVS/DRC/PEX cleanup under time pressure?

## ðŸš§ In Progress

This list will grow as I review, prep, and remember more interview conversations.
